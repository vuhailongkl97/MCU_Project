1.	Reliability: Any RTOS must be reliable. 
This means that it operates for a reasonably long time without human interference
. Reliability also means the configuration to enable the system to choose the right 
or most profitable action for current operations. For example, a system for the telecom or banking industries 
needs to consider the cost of terminating or engaging certain actions, compared to a phone or calculator
whose cost is limited to an individual, game, app function, etc.


2.	Predictability: A system must execute actions within a known time frame 
and produce known results
. Such results are determined by the procedures or operations taking place.
 The determination is by targets set during production or procedural planning.
 
 
 
3.	Performance: real-time operating systems are designed to make work easier. 
Every system must solve a problem or reduce the workload. 
As such, the developer should provide a system that is easily assimilated with existing software 
and hardware as well as aligned to the goals of the organization.



4.	 : This means a system whose veracity or bulkiness is manageable. 
The software and hardware required to operate the RTOS must be of reasonable size. 
Technicians should also be easy to find and orient. The idea is to reduce the cost of implementation.


5.	Scalability: The needs of any production or event environment change with time. 
 This means that a system may require an upgrade or downgrade.
Such provisions must be made during design and installation of any RTOS.
