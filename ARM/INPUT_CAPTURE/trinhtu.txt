1 disable it by resetting the EN bit in the DMA_SxCR register,. 
	+ wait for disable
	
2.Set the peripheral port register address in the DMA_SxPAR register. The data will be
moved from/ to this address to/ from the peripheral port after the peripheral event.
   + USART1 DR
   
3. Set the memory address in the DMA_SxMA0R register (and in the DMA_SxMA1R
register in the case of a double buffer mode). The data will be written to or read from
this memory after the peripheral event
	+ u32_t rx_data 

4.Configure the total number of data items to be transferred in the DMA_SxNDTR
register. After each peripheral event or each beat of the burst, this value is
decremented.
	1bytes  . 

5.Select the DMA channel (request) using CHSEL[2:0] in the DMA_SxCR register.
	channel 4
6.If the peripheral is intended to be the flow controller and if it supports this feature, set
the PFCTRL bit in the DMA_SxCR register.
	none
7.Configure the stream priority using the PL[1:0] bits in the DMA_SxCR register.
	low
8. Configure the FIFO usage (enable or disable, threshold in transmission and reception)
	disable
9. Configure the data transfer direction, peripheral and memory incremented/fixed mode,
single or burst transactions, peripheral and memory data widths, Circular mode,
Double buffer mode and interrupts after half and/or full transfer, and/or errors in the
DMA_SxCR register.

	peripheral to memory .increment memmory . peripheral ,memmory data widths byte
	Circular mode
10. Activate the stream by setting the EN bit in the DMA_SxCR register.
As soon as the stream is enabled, it can serve any DMA request from the peripheral
connected to the stream.
	enable

Warning: To switch off a peripheral connected to a DMA stream
request, it is mandatory to, first, switch off the DMA stream to
which the peripheral is connected, then to wait for EN bit = 0.
Only then can the peripheral be safely disabled.
